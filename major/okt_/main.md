okt_, which was the second attempt at an engine called Oksemon Tech (okt. "Oksemon" is a partially nonsense "company name", and "Tech" is just to mean an engine, like id Tech n), is an attempt at a 3D game engine with physics and levels loaded from files and such.
During development, ideas switched between things like a space sim and a first-person shooter, and there's even a branch for a 2.5D platformer.

It was my second time making my own physically-based rendering (PBR) system, this time with my own, more optimised (if I remember correctly) 2D/3D maths library, [Mathsies](https://github.com/wolfboyft/mathsies).
