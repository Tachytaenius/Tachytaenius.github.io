okt_, which was the second attempt at an engine called Oksemon Tech (okt. "Oksemon" is a partially nonsense "company name", and "Tech" is just to mean an engine, like id Tech n), is an attempt at a 3D game engine with physics and levels loaded from files and such.
During development, ideas switched between things like a space sim and a first-person shooter, and there's even a branch for a 2.5D platformer.

It was my second time making my own physically-based rendering (PBR) system, this time with my own, more optimised (if I remember correctly) 2D/3D maths library, [Mathsies](https://github.com/wolfboyft/mathsies).

## Screenshots

With a skybox of a Minecraft title screen panorama, the bottom left shows a gravity indicator much like the destination orientation indicator from Elite (with no dot, since there is no gravity), the grey box shows level geometry which can be collided with, and there is also a red ball demonstrating entity-entity collisions and emissive textures.
The player is emitting light.
