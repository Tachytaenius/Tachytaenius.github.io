# Unnnnamed RPG

This was going to be an attempt at a sort of farming and crafting game with some elements of exploration.
It was mostly prototyping and trying to see what would be good.
It has a few interesting features regarding timed mechanics like (inaccurate) silkworm farms and plants that grow fruits.
