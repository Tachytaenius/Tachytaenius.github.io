# Overworld

[GitHub](https://github.com/wolfboyft/overworld)

Overworld was originally intended to be a comfort game for someone, but as ideas changed over development, it went in a direction where it was going to become more of an exploration and industry sort of game, with a robust inventory system that would allow for things like automated item processing, but I had allowed myself to bodge a little too much and the code was unusable, though it's not like I couldn't've rewritten it.
It uses the same assets (or at least style) as Unnnnamed RPG.

During map generation, different noise maps are used to determine rockiness and forestedness, which determine the chances of a tile being tree or boulder, and also the likelihood of an appropriate item (a piece of stone or a stick) appearing on that tile.
