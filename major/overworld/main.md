# Overworld

[GitHub](https://github.com/wolfboyft/overworld)

Overworld was going to be an exploration and industry sort of game, with a robust inventory system that would allow for things like automated item processing, but I had allowed myself to bodge a little too much and the code was unusable.
It uses the same assets (or at least style) as Unnnnamed RPG.
