# Unnnnamed Platformer

This was an attempt at a generic platforming game.
I had allowed myself to bodge code in this one, which got pretty bad, but there are lots of parameters for how the controls feel that can be changed in a json file for the player's entity type.
It was a challenge to force myself to not have perfectly parabolic jumping arcs.

The levels are made in Tiled, though I hadn't figured out a good workflow for Tiled maps that allows for things like adding new tiles and such.
