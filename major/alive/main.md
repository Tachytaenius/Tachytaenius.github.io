## Alive

Alive is one of my dream games. It's supposed to be a top-down 2D experience. The intention is to make an immersive survival game with/simulating things such as:
- Soil constituents
- Grass health
- A unique top-down far vision system
- View occluded/recoloured by walls/coloured glass
- Hunting
- Underground areas (like in the 2D game Minicraft)
- Fluid dynamics with conservation of total water quantity

...and  much else besides.

The idea has currently spawned two repositories:
- [Alive-old](https://github.com/wolfboyft/Alive-old) (initial commit 2018-09-16), which has a few iterations within its (very bad) commit history
- (As of 2023-05-12) [Alive](https://github.com/wolfboyft/Alive) (initial commit 2022-09-20) for which I used issues to track to-dos, which was not necessarily wise.

They both use the LÃ–VE framework, and the latter was doing very well until I hit limitations in Lua that were difficult to overcome, at which point I decided the next (and as always, hopefully final) iteration of the project would be made in Rust, very likely using the Bevy game engine.
